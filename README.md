## Interesting points

- One of the key decisions I made was to organize the components based on their functionality and reusability. This approach made the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

- I utilized React Hooks for state management, which simplified the codebase and improved performance. Using useState and useEffect hooks made it easier to manage component state and side effects.
